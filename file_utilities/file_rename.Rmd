## file renaming

https://www.statology.org/rename-file-in-r/


Rename multiple files with a particular pattern


Example: File folder with band name, remove band name from sub-folders


* NOTE: a file with the full `file_pattern` before the "." extension will a) be renamed with no name, and should appear in your Windows file exporer but not your RStudio project

```{r}

# set the artist name (used to set working directory and string to replace)
artist <- "Steely Dan"

setwd(glue::glue("{artist}"))
getwd()

# note either hyphen or N-dash (<alt>0150)
file_pattern <- glue::glue('{artist} [-â€“] ')
list.files(pattern = file_pattern)

# replacement
file.rename(list.files(pattern = file_pattern),
            stringr::str_replace(list.files(pattern =file_pattern), pattern=file_pattern, ''))

```

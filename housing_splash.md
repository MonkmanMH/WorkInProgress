# Housing data viz app - splash page

Welcome to the British Columbia housing data visualization application!

This app was created as a proof-of-concept, and does not provide a comprehensive catalogue of data relevant to housing in the province. Instead, it combines a visualization of a single administrative data series (the Property Transfer Tax, collected by the B.C. Ministry of Finance) with some of the data from the Census of Canada (collected by Statistics Canada).

We recognize that there are other administrative series that are of relevance to informing policy, as well as other Census data that are of interest (such as the proportion of people who rent or own in a particular area).

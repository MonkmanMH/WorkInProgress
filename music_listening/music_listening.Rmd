I've been working from home since mid-March. This has afforded me the opportunity to listen to more of my collection of LPs and CDs than I might normally. But how much more?

```{r setup}

```{r}

df_playlist <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kHBEMFEDwyszldNbNvD2A6Pt8KYoUACDZZ0usWvrruA/edit?usp=sharing")


df_playlist

```



```{r}

  select("index" = (starts_with("index:")), 
         year, month, day,
         date_of_acquisition,
         format, disc_num,
         genre) %>%

  filter(play_date > as_date("2017-01-01"))

df_playlist_trim

df_playlist_trim %>% 
  group_by(date_of_acquisition) %>% 
  tally

df_play_summary <- df_playlist_trim %>% 
  group_by(play_date) %>% 
  tally()

df_play_summary <- df_play_summary %>%
  mutate(roll_avg = roll_mean(x = n, n = 14, fill = NA))

df_play_summary

```

```{r}

ggplot(df_play_summary, aes(x = play_date, y = roll_avg)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.25)

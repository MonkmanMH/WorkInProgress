# Same name, different bird

What do we mean when we see a bird and say that it's a robin? A lot depends on your location. Superficially, the European robin and the American robin are similar--brownish birds with a red breast. 

But when we look more closely, we see that they are fundamentally different. The European robin (_Erithacus rubecula_) is an Old World flycatcher, catching insects on the wing.

The American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) is a thrush, and eats earthworms and other invertebrates, along with fruits and berries.

(The naming of the American robin is a classic case of ["The Captain's Hat"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df-uemc-e3w); European explorers and colonists arriving in other parts of the world and naming things in a way that isn't necessarily accurate.)


Similarly, what do we mean when we say "data scientist"? 

Here's a tweet by JD Long:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why does data science exist as “a thing”? I postulate: the transaction costs of getting stats, biz, &amp; dev people working together outweigh the gains from specialization. This has been wildly misunderstood by management consultants who fetishize gains from specialization.</p>&mdash; JD Long (@CMastication) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1126457956269285376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2019</a></blockquote>

The second tweet in his thread was the one that caught my attention:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Data Science got initial traction inside of small firms &amp; startups that needed fast iteration &amp; could not support specialists in data, stats, hacking &amp; biz. They grew up this hybrid that combines domains and doesn’t specialize. In large orgs there becomes friction w specialists.</p>&mdash; JD Long (@CMastication) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1126458904060276736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2019</a></blockquote>

This tweet, and some of the key responses, provoked some thinking.
